"bcrypt" is a library for securely hashing passwords in our web applications.
To hash a password we use "bcrypt.hash" function , which takes password as the input and generates a hashed version of the password
We can also specify a "salt" factor which adds randomness to the hash to make it more secure. Higher the salt factor more secure the hash is , but will take more time to compute though.
When the user attempts to log in, we can compare the entered password with the stored hashed password to verify it.
To compare we use 'bcrypt.compare'
